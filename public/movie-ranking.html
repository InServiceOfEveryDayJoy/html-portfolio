<h1>The Best Christmas Movies of All Time</h1>
<h2>My Top 3</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer</h3>
<p>This claymation classic shows us what it means to perservere even when others want you to fail</p>
<h3>Home Alone</h3>
<p>This classic Christmas movie starring McCauley Caulkin is just as hilarious today as it was when it was originally released in 1990</p>
<h3>Scrooged</h3>
<p>...With Bill Murray as the star you may not think this Christmas comedy is deep but it will leave you reflecting on your values and striving to raise good humans, even if that good human is yourself!</p>
